\subsection*{Density and Mass}

\textbf{Density} is the concentration of mass in an object. Usually density indicates mass per volume (e.g., kg/m$^3$) and an object with uniform density satisfies the equation

$$\text{mass}=\text{density}\cdot\text{volume}.$$

\vspace{3mm}

If the density varies with the object, we need to use calculus. The problem of finding the mass of a 2- or 3-dimensional object given a density function that varies by position requires multi-variable calculus. So we will look at the problem of finding the mass of a 1-dimensional object using calculus. For 1-dimensional objects, we use \textit{linear density} (e.g., kg/m).

\vspace{5mm}

\textbf{Goal:} Suppose a 1-dimensional object, such as a thin bar or wire, is represented by the interval $a\leq x\leq b$. Find the mass of the object given that the object's linear density $\rho(x)$ varies along its length.

\newpage

\Example A thin bar is represented by the interval $0\leq x\leq\pi$. Find the mass of this bar if its density is given by $\rho(x)=1+\sin x$.

\subsection*{Work}

\textbf{Work} is an important concept for determining the amount of energy needed to perform various tasks. Work is done when a force moves an object.\\

\textbf{Examples of situations where we want to find the amount of work done.}
\begin{itemize}
\item the work needed to lift a heavy object
\item the work needed to wind up a heavy chain
\item the work needed to pump water up and out of a tank
\item the work needed to stretch or compress a spring
\end{itemize}
