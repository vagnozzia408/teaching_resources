\section*{8.5: Partial Fractions}

\boxenv{Learning Objectives.}{Upon successful completion of Section 8.5, you will be able to\dots
		
	\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=6mm]
		\item Answer conceptual questions involving partial fractions.
		\item Set up or find a partial fraction decomposition.
		\item Evaluate integrals involving partial fractions with only simple linear factors.
		\item Evaluate integrals involving partial fractions with repeated linear factors.
		\item Evaluate integrals involving partial fractions with irreducible quadratic factors (simple or repeated).
		\item Evaluate integrals involving improper rational functions (where long division is needed first).
		\item Use partial fractions to find areas, volumes, or arc lengths.
		\item Evaluate integrals involving partial fractions that require a preliminary step (such as a change of variables).
