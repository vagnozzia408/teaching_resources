\boxenv{Learning Objectives.}{Upon successful completion of Section 6.4, you will be able to\dots
		
	\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=6mm]
		\item Answer conceptual questions involving the Shell Method.
		\item Use the shell method to find the volume of the solid of revolution about the $y$-axis.
		\item Use the shell method to find the volume of the solid of revolution about the $x$-axis.
		\item Use the shell method to find the volume of the solid of revolution about other horizontal and vertical lines (other than the $x$-axis and $y$-axis).
		\item Use both the shell method and washer method to find the volume of the solid of revolution about an indicated axis or line.
		\item Find the volume of a solid of revolution using any method.
		\item Solve applications involving the shell method.
