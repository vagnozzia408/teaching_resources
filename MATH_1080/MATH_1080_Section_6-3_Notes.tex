\subsection*{General Slicing Method}

\vspace{43mm}

\boxenv{Definition.}{Let $S$ be a solid that lies between $x=a$ and $x=b$. If the cross sections of $S$ are perpendicular to the $x$-axis and have area $A(x)$, where $A$ is a continuous function, then the \textbf{volume} of $S$ is

$$V=\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{i=1}^n A\left(x_i^*\right)\Delta x=\int_a^b A(x)\,dx.$$
}

\vspace{5mm}

\textbf{Note:} If $S$ is a solid lying between $y=c$ and $y=d$ with cross sections perpendicular to the $y$-axis that have area $A(y)$, where $A$ is a continuous function, then 

$$V=\int_c^d A(y)\,dy.$$

\newpage

\Example Find the volume of the solid with circular base of radius 5 whose cross sections perpendicular to the base and parallel to the $x$-axis are equilateral triangles.

\vspace{80mm}

A specific type of solid we will work with is a \textbf{solid of revolution}. Suppose $f$ is a continuous function on $[a,b]$ and $R$ is the region bounded by the graph of $f$, the $x$-axis, and the lines $x=a$ and $x=b$.

\vspace{50mm}

\textbf{Goal:} Find the volume of the solid generated by revolving the region $R$ about the $x$-axis.\\

\textbf{Idea:} Think about \underline{slices}.

\newpage 

\Example Let $R$ be the region bounded by $y=\sqrt{x-1}$, $y=0$, and $x=5$. Find the volume of the solid generated when $R$ is rotated about the $x$-axis.

\vspace{100mm}

\Example Let $R$ be the region bounded by $y=x^3$, $y=x$, and $x\geq 0$. Find the volume of the solid generated when $R$ is rotated about the $x$-axis.

\newpage

\Example Let $R$ be the region bounded by $y=\sqrt{x-1}$, $y=0$, and $x=5$. Set up the integral(s) needed to find the volume of the solid generated when $R$ is rotated about the line $y=2$.

\vspace{70mm}

\Example Let $R$ be the region bounded by $y=\ln x$, $y=1$, $y=2$, and $x=0$.

\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] Find the volume of the solid generated when $R$ is rotated about the $y$-axis.

\vspace{70mm}

\item[(b)] Set up the integral(s) needed to find the volume of the solid generated when $R$ is rotated about the line $x=-2$.
