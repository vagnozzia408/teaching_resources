		\item Answer conceptual questions about finding areas between curves.
		\item Find the area of a region using geometry.
		\item Find the area of a region (either by integrating with respect to $x$ or by integrating with respect to $y$) when the figure of the region is provided.
		\item Set up the area of a region in two ways: (1) in terms of one or more integrals with respect to $x$ and (2) in terms of one or more integrals with respect to $y$.
		\item Sketch a given region and find its area.
