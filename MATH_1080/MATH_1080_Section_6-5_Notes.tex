\subsection*{Finding a Formula for Arc Length}

\textbf{Goal:} Find the length of a curve $C$ defined by $y=f(x)$, $a\leq x \leq b$, where $f'$ is continuous on $[a,b]$.

\newpage

\boxenv{Arc Length.}{Consider a curve $C$ defined by $y=f(x)$, where $a\leq x\leq b$ and $f'$ is continuous on $[a,b]$. The length $L$ of the curve is given by
$$L=\int_a^b\sqrt{1+\big(f'(x)\big)^2}\,dx.$$

\vspace{-3mm}}

\Example Find the arc length of the curve $x=\disp\frac{y^4}{8}+\frac{1}{4y^2}$, $1\leq y \leq 2$.

\newpage

\Example Find the arc length of the curve $y=\disp\frac{1}{2}\left(e^x+e^{-x}\right)$ on $\left[-\ln 2, \ln 2\right]$.

\newpage

\Example Set up and simplify the integral that gives the arc length of the curve $y=\ln x$ for $1\leq x\leq 4$.

\vfill

\textbf{Note:} Arc length integrals are often difficult to evaluate analytically, even for simple functions. We will be able to evaluate even more types of integrals after learning more integration techniques in Chapter 8.
