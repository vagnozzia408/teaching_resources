\section*{11.3: Taylor Series}

\boxenv{Learning Objectives.}{Upon successful completion of Section 11.3, you will be able to\dots
		
	\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=6mm]
		\item Answer conceptual questions involving Taylor series.
		\item Find the Taylor series and interval of convergence for functions centered at $a$.
		\item Find the Taylor series for a given function centered at $a$.
		\item Manipulate a given Taylor series to find the Taylor series for a function centered at $0$.
		\item Find remainders for Taylor series and show the remainder for certain Taylor series goes to $0$ as $n$ goes to infinity for all $x$ in the interval of convergence.
